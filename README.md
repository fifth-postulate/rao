Independent verification of the classification of tilings by convex pentagons.

## Paper
Michael Rao's paper [Exhaustive search of convex pentagons which tile the plane][paper:rao] contains a proof that the classification of [tilings by convex pentagons][wikipedia:pentagonal_tiling] is complete.

The paper is centered around two algorithms, with accompanying definitions, theorems and proofs.

## Goal
The goal for this repository is to develop an independent verification of Rao's result.
